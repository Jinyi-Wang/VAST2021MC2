# VAST2021MC2

It is the code to solve the problems in VAST2021, mini-challenge 2.   
The site of VAST is https://vast-challenge.github.io/2021/index.html.  
   
The main task is to find the suspect with the data of the car's GPS and people's consumption.


## Code
I only finished task one. And I am a new learner of data visualization(there are other better ways to solve the task).  
The code uses the package matplotlib to draw heatmap and bar graphs with the data.   
I designed to categorize the places. It could help in analyzing people's behavior.  
And I designed to find popular places with two aspects: the consumption times and amounts.
   
Since data cc_data.csv and loyalty_data.csv have different lengths in rows, I calculated to make sure the consumption recorded in two csvs are not the same first. (It doesn't matter in task one.)
